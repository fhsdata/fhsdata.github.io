<p>Hermes improves React Native performance by decreasing memory utilization, reducing download size, and decreasing the time it takes for the app to become usable or “time to interactive” (TTI).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As we analyzed performance data, we noticed that the JavaScript engine itself was a significant factor in startup performance and download size. With this data in hand, we knew we had to optimize JavaScript performance in the more constrained environments of a mobile phone compared with a desktop or laptop. After exploring other options, we built a new JavaScript engine we call Hermes. It is designed to improve app performance, focusing on our React Native apps, even on mass-market devices with limited memory, slow storage, and reduced computing power.” —<a href="https://code.fb.com/android/hermes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hermes: An open source JavaScript engine optimized for mobile apps, starting with React Native</a></p>

<p>There have been many improvements to the accessibility APIs, like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/cfe0032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announceForAccessibility</a>, plus improvements to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1aeac1c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roles</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/14b4668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">action support</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/0090ab3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flags</a>, and more. Accessibility is a complex science, but we hope these improvements make it a bit easier to be an A11Y. Be sure to check <a href="/blog/2019/06/12/react-native-open-source-update#meaningful-community-contributions">React Native Open Source Update June 2019</a> for more details of these changes.</p>

<p>React Native&#x27;s start screen has been updated! Thank you to the many contributors who helped create the new UI. This new &quot;Hello World&quot; will welcome users to the ecosystem in a more friendly, engaging way.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="androidx-support">AndroidX Support<a href="#androidx-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AndroidX Support" title="Direct link to AndroidX Support">​</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AndroidX</a> is a major step forward in the Android ecosystem, and the old support library artifacts are being deprecated. For 0.60, React Native has been migrated over to AndroidX. This is a breaking change, and <strong>your native code and dependencies will need to be migrated</strong> as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With this change, React Native apps will need to begin using AndroidX themselves. They cannot be used side-by-side in one app, so all of the app code and dependency code needs to be using one or the other.</p>

<p>While your own native code will need to be migrated by you, <a href="https://github.com/mikehardy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@mikehardy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cawfree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@cawfree</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/m4tt72" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@m4tt72</a> built a <a href="https://github.com/mikehardy/jetifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clever tool named &quot;jetifier&quot;</a> to patch your <code>node_modules</code>. Library maintainers will need to upgrade, but this tool provide you with a temporary solution while giving them time to release an AndroidX version. So if you find errors related to AndroidX migration, give this a shot.</p>

Also, the <code>podspec</code>s for the internal packages have changed to make them compatible with the Xcode projects, which will help with troubleshooting and debugging. Expect to make <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/2321b3f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some straightforward changes</a> to your <code>Podfile</code> as part of the upgrade to 0.60 to bring this exciting support.

<p><strong>WebView</strong> and <strong>NetInfo</strong> were previously extracted into separate repositories, and in 0.60 we’ve finished migrating them out of the React Native repository. Additionally, in response to community feedback about new App Store policy, <strong>Geolocation</strong> has been extracted. If you haven’t already, complete your migration by adding dependencies to <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react-native-webview</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@react-native-community/netinfo</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-geolocation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@react-native-community/geolocation</a>. If you&#x27;d like an automated solution, consider using <a href="https://github.com/lucasbento/rn-update-deprecated-modules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rn-upgrade-deprecated-modules</a>.

<p>Changes for AndroidX will almost certainly require updates to your library, so be sure to include support soon. If you&#x27;re not able to upgrade yet, consider checking your library against the jetifier to confirm that users are able to patch your library at build time.</p>
<p>Review the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autolinking</a> docs to update your configs and readme. Depending on how your library was previously integrated, you may also need to make some additional changes. Check the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/dependencies.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dependencies</a> guide from the CLI for information on how to define your dependency interface.</p>

<p>We’d like to highlight a number of recent contributions which we thought were awesome:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> React Native 0.60 will ship with many improvements to accessibility APIs both on Android and iOS. All of the new features are directly using APIs provided by the underlying platform so they’ll integrate with native assistance technologies both on Android and iOS.

<li><strong>Haste:</strong> Since 2015 React Native used the <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/commit/0629e3e2289ed54fac854472aec9a5f6c8318c98#diff-c42b758729cb89976b3a8fd51d1227fa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“haste” module system</a> that allows importing modules just via a global id instead of a relative path which is convenient but not well supported by many tools. <a href="https://twitter.com/JI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Ide</a> proposed removing haste, similar to how React removed haste many years ago. He planned all the work through an <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/24316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">umbrella task</a> and he sent 18 Pull Requests to make it happen!

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="lean-core">Lean Core<a href="#lean-core" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lean Core" title="Direct link to Lean Core">​</a></h3>
<p>The primary motivation of <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lean Core</a> has been to split modules out of React Native into separate repositories so they can receive better maintenance. In just a six months repositories like <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebView</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NetInfo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-async-storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AsyncStorage</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLI</a> received more than 800 Pull Requests combined. Besides better maintenance, these projects can also be independently released more often than React Native itself.</p>
<p>We have also taken the opportunity to remove obsolete polyfills and legacy components from React Native itself. Polyfills were necessary in the past to support language features like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Map</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Set</code></a> in older versions of JavaScriptCore (JSC). Now that React Native ships with a new version, these polyfills were removed.</p>
<p>This work is still in progress and many more things still need to be split out or removed both on the native and JavaScript side but there are early signs that we managed to reverse the trend of increasing the surface area and app size: When looking at the JavaScript bundle for example, about a year ago in version 0.54 the React Native JavaScript bundle size was 530kb and grew to 607kb (+77kb) by version 0.57 in just 6 months. Now we are seeing a bundle size reduction of 28kb down to 579kb on master, a delta of more than 100kb!</p>
<p>As we conclude the first iteration of the Lean Core effort, we will make an effort to be more intentional about new APIs added to React Native and we will continuously evaluate ways to make React Native smaller and faster, as well as finding ways to empower the community to take ownership of various components.</p>

<p>Six months ago we asked the community “<a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What do you dislike about React Native?</a>” which gave a good overview of problems people are facing. We <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replied to the post a few months ago</a> and it&#x27;s time to summarize the progress that was made on top issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upgrading:</strong> The React Native community rallied around with multiple improvements to the upgrading experience: <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autolinking</a>, a better upgrading command via <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rn-diff-purge</a>, an upgrade helper website (coming soon). We’ll also make sure to communicate breaking changes and exciting new features by publishing blog posts for each major release. Many of these improvements will make future upgrades beyond the 0.60 release significantly easier.</li>
<li><strong>Support / Uncertainty:</strong> Many people were frustrated with the lack of activity on Pull Requests and general uncertainty about Facebook&#x27;s investment in React Native. As we&#x27;ve shown above, we can confidently say that we are ready for many more Pull Requests and we are eagerly looking forward to your proposals and contributions!</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> React Native 0.59 shipped with a new and much faster version of JavaScriptCore (JSC). Separately, we have been working on making it easier to enable <a href="/docs/performance#ram-bundles-inline-requires">inline-requires</a> by default and we have more exciting updates for you in the next couple of months.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> We recently started an effort to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overhaul and rewrite all of React Native&#x27;s documentation</a>. If you are looking to contribute, we’d love to get your help!</li>
<li><strong>Warnings in Xcode:</strong> We <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got rid of all the existing warnings</a> and are making an effort not to introduce new warnings.</li>
<li><strong>Hot Reloading:</strong> The React team is building a <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1126948870137753605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new hot reloading system</a> that will soon be integrated into React Native.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately we weren’t able to improve everything just yet:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debugging:</strong> We fixed many inconvenient bugs and issues people that we have been running into every day, but unfortunately we haven&#x27;t made as much progress on this as we would like. We recognize that debugging with React Native isn&#x27;t great and we&#x27;ll prioritize improving this in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Metro symlinks:</strong> Unfortunately we haven&#x27;t been able to implement a simple and straightforward solution for this yet. However, React Native users <a href="https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared various workarounds</a> that may work for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the large amount of changes in the past six months, we&#x27;d like to ask you the same question again. If you are using the latest version of React Native and you have things you&#x27;d like to give feedback on, please comment on our new edition of <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“What do you dislike about React Native?”</a></p>

<p>Facebook merges all Pull Requests and internal changes directly into Facebook’s repository first and then syncs all commits back to GitHub. Facebook’s infrastructure is different from common continuous integration services and not all open source tests were run inside of Facebook. This means that commits that sync out to GitHub frequently break tests in open source which take a lot of time to fix.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hectorramos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Héctor Ramos</a> from the React Native team spent the past two months improving React Native&#x27;s continuous integration systems both at Facebook and on GitHub. Most of the open source tests are now run before changes are committed to React Native at Facebook which will keep CI stable on GitHub when commits are being synchronized.</p>

<ul>
<li>We spent 2017 and 2018 focused on React Native&#x27;s largest product, Facebook&#x27;s Marketplace. We collaborated with the Marketplace team to improve quality and add delight to the product. At this point, Marketplace is one of the highest quality products in the Facebook app both on Android and iOS.</li>
<li>Marketplace&#x27;s performance was a big challenge as well, especially on mid-end Android devices. We cut startup time by more than 50% over the last year with more improvements on the way! The biggest improvements are being built into React Native and will be coming to the community later this year.</li>
<li>We have the confidence that we can build the high quality and performant apps that Facebook needs with React Native. This confidence has let us invest in bigger bets, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcqRXTriUVI&amp;app=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rethinking the core of React Native</a>.</li>

<p>React Native uses JSC (<a href="https://webkit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScriptCore</a>) to power your application. JSC on Android was a few years old, which meant that a lot of modern JavaScript features weren&#x27;t supported. Even worse, it performed poorly compared iOS&#x27;s modern JSC. With this release, that all changes.</p>
<p>Thanks to some awesome work by <a href="https://github.com/danielzlotin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@DanielZlotin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dulmandakh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@dulmandakh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gengjiawen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@gengjiawen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kmagiera" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@kmagiera</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kudo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@kudo</a> JSC has caught up with the past few years.

<p>We want to help people have performant React Native apps by default and are working to bring Facebook&#x27;s optimizations to the community. Applications load resources as needed rather than slowing down launch. This feature is called &quot;inline requires&quot;, as it lets Metro identify components to be lazy loaded. Apps with a deep and varied component architecture will see the most improvement.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="source of the metro.config.js file in the 0.59 template, demonstrating where to enable inlineRequires" src="/assets/images/inline-requires-3cb1be96938288642a666bdf3dca62b5.png" width="724" height="485" class="img_SS3x"></p>
<p>We need the community to let us know how it works before we turn it on by default. When you upgrade to 0.59, there will be a new <code>metro.config.js</code> file; flip the options to true and give us <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/inline-requires" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your feedback</a>! Read more about inline requires <a href="/docs/performance#inline-requires">in the performance docs</a> to benchmark your app.</p>

<p>React Native is a large and complex project with a complicated repository. This makes the codebase less approachable to contributors, difficult to test, and bloated as a dev dependency. <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lean Core</a> is our effort to address these issues by migrating code to separate libraries for better management. The past few releases have seen the first steps of this, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMLKb4or8yg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let&#x27;s get serious</a>.</p>
<p>You may notice that additional components are now officially deprecated. This is great news, as there are now owners for these features actively maintaining them. Heed the warning messages and migrate to the new libraries for these features, because they will be removed in a future release. Below is a table indicating the component, its status, and where you may migrate your use to.</p>

<p>We heard your feedback regarding the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native upgrade process</a> and we are taking steps to improve the experience in <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64#issuecomment-444775432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">future releases</a>. To upgrade to 0.59, we recommend using <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>rn-diff-purge</code></a> to determine what has changed between your current React Native version and 0.59, then applying those changes manually. Once you&#x27;ve upgraded your project to 0.59, you will be able to use the newly improved <code>react-native upgrade</code> command (based on <code>rn-diff-purge</code>!) to upgrade to 0.60 and beyond as newer releases become available.</p>

<p>Android support in 0.59 has been cleaned up following Google&#x27;s latest recommendations, which may result in potential breakage of existing apps. This issue might present as a runtime crash and a message, &quot;You need to use a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant) with this activity&quot;. We recommend updating your project&#x27;s <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file, making sure that the <code>android:theme</code> value is an <code>AppCompat</code> theme (such as <code>@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar</code>).</p>
<p>The <code>react-native-git-upgrade</code> command has been removed in 0.59, in favor of the newly improved <code>react-native upgrade</code> command.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="-thanks">🤗 Thanks<a href="#-thanks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🤗 Thanks" title="Direct link to 🤗 Thanks">​</a></h2>
<p>Lots of new contributors helped with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enabling generation of native code from flow types</a> and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resolving Xcode warnings</a> - these are a great way to learn how React Native works and contributing to the greater good. Thank you! Look out for similar issues in the future.</p>
<p>While these are the highlights that we noted, there are many others to be excited about. To see all of the updates, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changelog</a>. 0.59 is a huge release – we can&#x27;t wait for you to try it out.</p>
<p>We have even more improvements coming throughout the rest of the year. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>For our first milestone, we focused on identifying and improving the most visible aspects of our community. Our goals were to reduce outstanding pull requests, reduce the project&#x27;s surface area, identify leading user problems, and establish guidelines for community management.</p>
<p>In the past two months, we made more progress than we expected. Read on for more details:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="pull-requests">Pull Requests<a href="#pull-requests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pull Requests" title="Direct link to Pull Requests">​</a></h3>
<p>In order to build a healthy community, we must respond quickly to code contributions. In past years, we de-prioritized reviewing community contributions and accumulated 280 pull requests (December 2018). In the first milestone, we reduced the number of open pull requests to ~65. Simultaneously, the average number of pull requests opened per day increased from 3.5 to 7 which means we have handled about <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?page=24&amp;q=is%3Apr+closed%3A%3E2018-12-01&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">600 pull requests</a> in the last three months.</p>
<p>We merged <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+closed%3A%3E2018-12-01+label%3A%22Merged%22+" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almost two-thirds</a> and closed one-third of the pull requests. They were closed without being merged if they are obsolete or low quality, or if they unnecessarily increase the project&#x27;s surface area. Most of the merged pull requests fixed bugs, improved cross-platform parity, or introduced new features. Notable contributions include improving type safety and the ongoing work to support AndroidX.</p>
<p>At Facebook, we run React Native from master, so we test all changes first before they make it into a React Native Release. Out of all the merged pull requests, only six caused issues: four only affected internal development and two were caught in the release candidate state.</p>
<p>One of the more visible community contributions was <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/22242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the updated “RedBox” screen</a>. It&#x27;s a good example of how the community is making the developer experience friendlier.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="lean-core">Lean Core<a href="#lean-core" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lean Core" title="Direct link to Lean Core">​</a></h3>
<p>React Native currently has a very wide surface area with many unmaintained abstractions that we do not use a lot at Facebook. We are working on reducing the surface area in order to make React Native smaller and allow the community to take better care of abstractions that are mostly unused at Facebook.</p>
<p>In the first milestone, <a href="https://twitter.com/reactnative/status/1093171521114247171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we asked the community for help on the Lean Core project</a>. The response was overwhelming and we could barely keep up with all the progress. <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out all the work completed in less than a month</a>!</p>
<p>What we are most excited about is that maintainers have jumped in fixing long standing issues, adding tests, and supporting long requested features. These modules are getting more support than they ever did within React Native, showing that this is a great step for the community. Examples of such projects are <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebView</a> that has <a href="https://twitter.com/titozzz/status/1101283928026034176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">received many pull requests</a> since their extraction and the CLI that is now <a href="https://blog.callstack.io/the-react-native-cli-has-a-new-home-79b63838f0e6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maintained by members of the community</a> and received much needed improvements and fixes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="leading-user-problems">Leading User Problems<a href="#leading-user-problems" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Leading User Problems" title="Direct link to Leading User Problems">​</a></h3>
<p>In December, we asked the community what they <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disliked about React Native</a>. We aggregated the responses and <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replied to each and every problem</a>. Fortunately, many of the issues that our community faces are also problems at Facebook. In our next milestone, we plan to address some of the main problems.</p>
<p>One of the highest voted problems was the developer experience of upgrading to newer versions of React Native. Unfortunately, this is not something that we experience ourselves because we run React Native from master. Thankfully, members from the community already stepped up to address this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/thymikee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michał Pierzchała</a> from Callstack <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-cli/pull/176/files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improved react-native upgrade</a> by using <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rn-diff-purge</a> under the hood. We also updated the website to remove outdated upgrade instructions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/23563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We plan on recommending CocoaPods by default for iOS projects</a> which will reduce churn in project files when upgrading React Native. This will make it easier for people to install and link third-party modules which is even more important in the context of Lean Core as we expect projects to link more modules by default.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="059-release">0.59 Release<a href="#059-release" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 0.59 Release" title="Direct link to 0.59 Release">​</a></h3>
<p>Without the help of the React Native community, especially <a href="https://github.com/grabbou" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Grabowski</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kelset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lorenzo Sciandra</a>, we would not be able to ship releases. We want to improve the release management process and plan to be more involved from now on:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will work with community members to create a blog post for each major release.</li>
<li>We will show breaking changes directly in the CLI when people upgrade to new versions.</li>
<li>We will reduce the time it takes to make a release. We are exploring ways to increase automated testing and also creating an improved manual test plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these plans will be incorporated in the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.59.0-rc.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native 0.59 release</a>. 0.59 will ship with React Hooks, a new 64-bit version of JavaScriptCore for Android, and many performance and functionality improvements. It is currently published as a release candidate and is expected to be stable within the next two weeks.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="next-steps">Next Steps<a href="#next-steps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next Steps" title="Direct link to Next Steps">​</a></h3>
<p>For the next two months, we will continue managing pull requests <a href="https://k03lwm00zo.codesandbox.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to stay on track</a> while also starting to reduce the number of outstanding GitHub issues. We will continue reducing the surface area of React Native through the Lean Core project. We plan to address 5 of the top community problems. As we finalize the community guidelines, we will turn attention to our website and documentation.</p>
<p>We are very excited to host over ten contributors from our community at Facebook London in March to help drive several of these efforts. We are glad that you are using React Native and hope that you&#x27;ll see and feel the improvements we are working on in 2019. We&#x27;ll be back with another update in a few months and <em>will be merging your pull requests in the meantime!</em> ⚛️✌️</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_Ow0B padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_DFxh"><a class="tag_otG2 tagRegular_s0E1" href="/blog/tags/announcement">announcement</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="In 2018 the React Native Community made a number of changes to the way we develop and communicate about React Native.

We believe that a few years from now we will look back and see that this shift was a turning point for React Native.</p>
<p>A lot of people are excited about the rewrite of React Native&#x27;s architecture, widely known as <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fabric</a>. Among other things, this will fix fundamental limitations in React Native&#x27;s architecture and will set up React Native for success in the future together with <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSI and TurboModules</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest shift in 2018 was to empower the React Native Community. From the beginning, Facebook encouraged developers from all around the world to participate in React Native&#x27;s open source project. Since then, a number of core contributors emerged to handle, among other things, the release process.</p>
<p>These members took a few substantial steps towards making the whole community more empowered to shape the future of this project with the following resources:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="react-native-releases-"><a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>react-native-releases</code></a> 📬<a href="#react-native-releases-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to react-native-releases-" title="Direct link to react-native-releases-">​</a></h2>
<p>This repository, created in January, serves the dual purpose of allowing everyone to keep up the new releases in a more collaborative manner and opened the conversation of what would be part of a certain release to whomever wanted to suggest a cherry-pick (like for <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.57.8</a> and all its previous versions).</p>
<p>This has been the driving force behind moving away from a monthly release cycle, and the &quot;long term support&quot; approach currently used for version 0.57.x.</p>
<p>Half of the credit for reaching these decisions goes to the other repository created this year:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="discussions-and-proposals-"><a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>discussions-and-proposals</code></a> 🗣<a href="#discussions-and-proposals-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to discussions-and-proposals-" title="Direct link to discussions-and-proposals-">​</a></h2>
<p>This repository, created in July, expanded on the idea of a more open environment for conversations on React Native. Previously, this need was handled by issues labelled <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/labels/For%20Discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>For Discussion</code></a> in the main repository, but we wanted to expand this strategy to an RFC approach that other libraries have (e.g. React).</p>
<p>This experiment immediately found its role in the React Native lifecycle. The Facebook team is now using the community RFC process to discuss what could <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">be improved in React Native</a>, and coordinate the efforts around the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lean Core project</a> - among other interesting discussions.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="reactnativecomm-"><a href="https://twitter.com/ReactNativeComm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ReactNativeComm</a> 🐣<a href="#reactnativecomm-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to reactnativecomm-" title="Direct link to reactnativecomm-">​</a></h2>
<p>We are aware that our approach to communicate these efforts has not been as effective as we would have liked, and in an attempt to give you all an easier time keeping up with everything going on in the React Native Community (from releases to active discussions) we created a new twitter account that you can rely on <a href="https://twitter.com/ReactNativeComm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ReactNativeComm</a>.</p>
<p>If you are not on that social network, remember that you can always watch repositories via GitHub; this feature improved these past few months with the possibility of being notified only for releases, so you should consider using it anyway.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="what-awaits-ahead-">What awaits ahead 🎓<a href="#what-awaits-ahead-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What awaits ahead 🎓" title="Direct link to What awaits ahead 🎓">​</a></h2>
<p>Over the past 7-8 months, core contributors enhanced the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native Community GitHub organization</a> to take more ownership over the development of React Native, and enhance collaboration with Facebook. But this always lacked the formal structure that similar projects may have in place.</p>
<p>This organization can set the example for everyone in the larger developer community by enforcing a set of standards for all the packages/repos hosted in it, providing a single place for maintainers to help each other and contribute quality code that conforms to community-agreed standards.</p>
<p>In early 2019, we will have this new set of guidelines in place. Let us know what you think in the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/63" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated discussion</a>.</p>
<p>We are confident that with these changes, the community will become more collaborative so that when we reach 1.0, we will all continue to write (even more) awesome apps by leveraging this joint effort 🤗</p>
<hr>
<p>I hope you are as excited as we are about the future of this community. We&#x27;re excited to see all of you involved either in the conversations happening in the repositories listed above or via the awesome code you’ll produce.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_Ow0B padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_DFxh"><a class="tag_otG2 tagRegular_s0E1" href="/blog/tags/announcement">announcement</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="This year, the React Native team has focused on a large scale re-architecture of React Native.

<p>This year, the React Native team has focused on a large scale <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-architecture of React Native</a>. As Sophie mentioned in her <a href="/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018">State of React Native post,</a> we&#x27;ve sketched out a plan to better support the thriving population of React Native users and collaborators outside of Facebook. It&#x27;s now time to share more details about what we&#x27;ve been working on. Before I do so, I&#x27;d like to lay out our long-term vision for React Native in open source.</p>
<p>Our vision for React Native is...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A healthy GitHub repository.</strong> Issues and pull requests get handled within a reasonable period of time.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Increased test coverage.</li>
<li>Commits that sync out from the Facebook code repository should not break open source tests.</li>
<li>A higher scale of meaningful community contributions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stable APIs,</strong> making it easier to interface with open source dependencies.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Facebook uses the same public API as open source</li>
<li>React Native releases that follow semantic versioning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A vibrant eco-system.</strong> High quality ViewManagers, native modules, and multiple platform support maintained by the community.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent documentation.</strong> Focus on helping users create high quality experiences, and up-to-date API reference docs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have identified the following focus areas to help us achieve this vision.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="️-lean-core">✂️ Lean Core<a href="#️-lean-core" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ✂️ Lean Core" title="Direct link to ✂️ Lean Core">​</a></h2>
<p>Our goal is to <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduce the surface area of React Native</a> by removing non-core and unused components. We&#x27;ll transfer non-core components to the community to allow it to move faster. The reduced surface area will make it easier to manage contributions to React Native.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0001-webview.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>WebView</code></a> is an example of a component that we transferred to the community. We are working on a workflow that will allow internal teams to continue using these components after we remove them from the repository. We have identified <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dozens more components</a> that we&#x27;ll give ownership of to the community.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="-open-sourcing-internals-and-updated-tooling">🎁 Open Sourcing Internals and 🛠Updated Tooling<a href="#-open-sourcing-internals-and-updated-tooling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🎁 Open Sourcing Internals and 🛠Updated Tooling" title="Direct link to 🎁 Open Sourcing Internals and 🛠Updated Tooling">​</a></h2>
<p>The React Native development experience for product teams at Facebook can be quite different from open source. Tools that may be popular in the open source community are not used at Facebook. There may be an internal tool that achieves the same purpose. In some cases, Facebook teams have become used to tools that do not exist outside of Facebook. These disparities can pose challenges when we open source our upcoming architecture work.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll work on releasing some of these internal tools. We&#x27;ll also improve support for tools popular with the open source community. Here&#x27;s a non-exhaustive list of projects we&#x27;ll tackle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open source JSI and enable the community to bring their own JavaScript VMs, replacing the existing JavaScriptCore from RN&#x27;s initial release. We&#x27;ll be covering what JSI is in a future post, in the meantime you can learn more about JSI from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcqRXTriUVI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parashuram&#x27;s talk at React Conf</a>.</li>
<li>Support 64-bit libraries on Android.</li>
<li>Enable debugging under the new architecture.</li>
<li>Improve support for CocoaPods, Gradle, Maven, and new Xcode build system.</li>
</ul>

<p>When Facebook engineers publish code, it&#x27;s considered safe to land if it passes all tests. These tests identify whether a change might break one of our own React Native surfaces. Yet, there are differences in how Facebook uses React Native. This has allowed us to unknowingly break React Native in open source.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll shore up our internal tests to ensure they run in an environment that is as close as possible to open source. This will help prevent code that breaks these tests from making it to open source. We will also work on infrastructure to enable better testing of the core repo on GitHub, enabling future pull requests to easily include tests.</p>
<p>Combined with the reduced surface area, this will allow contributors to merge pull requests quicker, with confidence.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="-public-api">📜 Public API<a href="#-public-api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 📜 Public API" title="Direct link to 📜 Public API">​</a></h2>
<p>Facebook will consume React Native via the public API, the same way open source does, to reduce unintentional breaking changes. We have started converting internal call sites to address this. Our goal is to converge on a stable, public API, leading to the adoption of semantic versioning in version 1.0.</p>

<p>React Native is one of the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/#top-and-trending-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top open source projects on GitHub</a> by contributor count. That makes us really happy, and we&#x27;d like to keep it going. We&#x27;ll continue working on initiatives that lead to involved contributors, such as increased transparency and open discussion. The documentation is one of the first things someone new to React Native will encounter, yet it has not been a priority. We&#x27;d like to fix that, starting with bringing back auto-generated API reference docs, creating additional content focused on creating <a href="/docs/improvingux">quality user experiences</a>, and improving our <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/47" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release notes</a>.</p>

<p>We&#x27;re planning to land these projects throughout the next year or so. Some of these efforts are already ongoing, such as <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/compare/e337bcafb0b017311c37f2dbc24e5a757af0a205...8427f64e06456f171f9df0316c6ca40613de7a20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSI which has already landed in open source</a>. Others will take a bit longer to complete, such as reducing the surface area. We&#x27;ll do our best to keep the community up to date with our progress. Please join us in the <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discussions and Proposals</a> repository, a initiative from the React Native community that has led to the creation of several of the initiatives discussed in this roadmap.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_Ow0B padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_DFxh"><a class="tag_otG2 tagRegular_s0E1" href="/blog/tags/announcement">announcement</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="The long-awaited 0.56 version of React Native is now available 🎉.

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contributor&#x27;s Guide</a> explains the integration process that all changes to React Native go through. The project has is composed by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many different tools</a>, requiring coordination and constant support to keep everything working properly. Add to this the vibrant open source community that contributes back to the project, and you will get a sense of the mind-bending scale of it all.</p>
<p>With React Native&#x27;s impressive adoption, breaking changes must be made with great care, and the process is not as smooth as we&#x27;d like. A decision was made to skip the April and May releases to allow the core team to integrate and test a new set of breaking changes. <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedicated community communication</a> channels were used along the way to ensure that the June 2018 (<code>0.56.0</code>) release is as hassle-free as possible to adopt by those who patiently waited for the stable release.</p>
<p>Is <code>0.56.0</code> perfect? No, as every piece of software out there: but we reached a point where the tradeoff between &quot;waiting for more stability&quot; versus &quot;testing led to successful results so we can push forward&quot; that we feel ready to release it. Moreover, we are aware <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issues</a> that are not solved in the final <code>0.56.0</code> release. Most developers should have no issues upgrading to <code>0.56.0</code>. For those that are blocked by the aforementioned issues, we hope to see you around in our discussions and we are looking forward to working with you on a solution to these issues.</p>
<p>You might consider <code>0.56.0</code> as a fundamental building block towards a more stable framework: it will take probably a week or two of widespread adoption before all the edge cases will be sanded off, but this will lead to an even better July 2018 (<code>0.57.0</code>) release.</p>
<p>We&#x27;d like to conclude this section by thanking <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/compare/v0.55.4...v0.56.0-rc.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all the 67 contributors who worked on a total of 818 commits</a> (!) that will help make your apps even better 👏.</p>

<p>On Android, much of the surrounding tooling has changed. We&#x27;ve updated to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/699e5eebe807d1ced660d2d2f39b5679d26925da" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gradle 3.5</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/065c5b6590de18281a8c592a04240751c655c03c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android SDK 26</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/6b07602915157f54c39adbf0f9746ac056ad2d13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fresco to 1.9.0, and OkHttp to 3.10.0</a> and even the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5ae97990418db613cd67b1fb9070ece976d17dc7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NDK API target to API 16</a>.

<p>Node 8 is now the standard for React Native. It was actually already being tested already, but we&#x27;ve put both feet forward as Node 6 entered maintenance mode. React was also updated to 16.4, which brings a ton of fixes with it.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re dropping support for iOS 8, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/f50df4f5eca4b4324ff18a49dcf8be3694482b51" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">making iOS 9 the oldest iOS version that can be targeted</a>. We do not foresee this being a problem, as any device that can run iOS 8, can be upgraded to iOS 9. This change allowed us to remove rarely-used code that implemented workarounds for older devices running iOS 8.</p>
<p>The continuous integration toolchain has been updated <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/c55bcd6ea729cdf57fc14a5478b7c2e3f6b2a94d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to use Xcode 9.4</a>, ensuring that all iOS tests are run on the latest developer tools provided by Apple.</p>
